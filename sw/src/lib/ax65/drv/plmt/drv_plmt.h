 * Platform-Level Machine Timer (PLMT)
 *
 * The NCEPLMT100 module implemented in the AX65 cluster is a RISC-V compliant machine timer,
 * providing a real-time counter and timer interrupt generation capabilities.

 *
 * Timer Functionality:
 * - The PLMT comprises a 64-bit counter (mtime) driven by a fixed-frequency timer clock (mtime_clk),
 *   which is not affected by the dynamic clock adjustments in the rest of the system. The mtime
 *   counter continuously increments in real-time and is used for generating precise timing events.
 *
 * - Each hart in the AX65 cluster has a corresponding 64-bit mtime comparison register (mtimecmpn),
 *   which is used to set up timer interrupts. An interrupt is triggered when the mtime counter value
 *   equals or surpasses the value set in mtimecmpn. Writing to mtimecmpn also clears the interrupt
 *   and deasserts the interrupt signal (mtip).
 *
 * Memory Mapped Registers:
 * - The PLMT registers, including mtime and multiple mtimecmpn registers (one for each hart), are
 *   accessible through the AX65 internal bus fabric. These registers support only 32-bit or 64-bit
 *   access, with narrower accesses being undefined and potentially leading to errors.
 *
 * Address Mapping:
 * - mtime is located at offsets 0x0 - 0x7 (split across two 32-bit registers for full 64-bit access).
 * - Each mtimecmp register for the harts (mtimecmpn) is spaced starting from 0x8, with each subsequent
 *   register spaced 8 bytes apart (each 64-bit register split into two 32-bit parts).
 *
