## 1. Manufacturing and Quality Control

### Key Requirements
- Real-time processing
- High precision
- Limited compute resources on factory floors

### Preferred Architectures
- **MobileNet & EfficientNet:** Used for visual inspection systems running on edge devices directly on production lines.
- **Specialized CNNs:** Custom shallow networks for detecting specific defects (e.g., cracks, deformations) with minimal false negatives.
- **Compact ResNets:** When higher accuracy is needed while maintaining reasonable inference speed.

### Example Application
- **PCB Defect Detection:** MobileNetV3 identifies microscopic soldering issues on limited hardware integrated into assembly equipment.

## 6. Agriculture and Environmental Monitoring

### Key Requirements
- Operation in variable weather
- Handling natural variability
- Limited connectivity

### Preferred Architectures
- MobileNet Variants: For deployment on agricultural drones and robots.
