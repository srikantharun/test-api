# Guidelines for clocks, related IOs and clock groups
#  1. each clock starts with dash (-)
#  2. clock parameters are defined using pairs of key and possible value (i.e. key: <value>)
#  3. freq - should be in MHz
#  4. dc (duty cycle) - should be in %
#  5. is_gen - should be true if it is generated clock
#  6. if is_gen is true - then div_by, master_clk, master_source must be defined as well
#  7. sync_with - only valid for non-generated clocks. If clock is asynchronous in nature wrt all other clocks, leave this empty.

  #  div_by: 2

  #  master_source: <master_clock source port or hierarchical pin>
  #  source: <name of hierarchical pin or port where clock should be defined>
  #  mode: <func | atspeed | shift>

# Guidelines for design intent constraints
#  1. constraints are grouped in different classes, each class name is followed by : (i.e. case_analysis:)
#  2. if no constraints for specific class, leave the class empty or can be removed
#  3. each class can have zero or more than zero constraints referred as group, and each group starts with dash (-) and is covered by [...]
#  4. each group is defined using pairs of key and possible value (i.e key: <value>)
#  5. each key should have valid value defined, and left blank whenever not applicable
#  6. any other design intent not templated below, can be added in similar format and BE will convert that in to valid timing constraints
